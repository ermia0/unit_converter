# Unit Converter (C++ Console App)

## 1) Rationale & Background (Why I Made This Software)
I made this **Unit Converter** program because in everyday life and in school we often use different measurement systems (Celsius/Fahrenheit, meters/kilometers, kilograms/pounds, etc.). Doing these conversions by hand can be confusing and it’s easy to make mistakes, especially with temperature formulas.

This program helps by:
- Making conversions **faster**
- Reducing **calculation errors**
- Keeping everything **organized** in menus
- Helping me practice important programming skills like functions, loops, and user input/output

I also added **colored text (ANSI escape codes)** to make the console easier to read and more user-friendly.

## 3) Usage of the Software (How to Use It)

### Main Menu
When the program starts, it shows a main menu with 4 options:
1) Temperature  
2) Length  
3) Weight  
4) Exit  

The user types a number (1–4) to choose a category.

---

### Temperature Conversions
If the user chooses **Temperature**, the program shows:
1) C -> F  
2) F -> C  
3) C -> K  
4) K -> C  
5) Back  

For options 1–4, the user enters a value and the program prints the converted result with the correct unit.

---

### Length Conversions
If the user chooses **Length**, the program shows:
1) cm -> m  
2) m -> cm  
3) m -> km  
4) km -> m  
5) Back  

For options 1–4, the user enters a value and the program prints the converted result.

---

### Weight Conversions
If the user chooses **Weight**, the program shows:
1) kg -> lb  
2) lb -> kg  
3) g -> kg  
4) kg -> g  
5) Back  

For options 1–4, the user enters a value and the program prints the converted result.

---

### Invalid Input
If the user types a number that is not in the menu, the program prints:
**"Invalid choice."**

---

## 4) Conclusion
This project successfully creates a simple and organized **menu-based unit converter**. It converts common units in temperature, length, and weight, and it is easy to use because everything is separated into clear categories.

This project also helped me practice important programming concepts such as:
- Using functions to organize code
- Using loops to keep menus running
- Using if/else statements for decision making
- Taking user input and printing output clearly

Overall, this program is a useful tool and a good beginner project for learning C++, especially for me as an ICS3U student, because this code forced me to use almost all of the topics I learned in Grade 11

## Setup
To set up the program, make sure all project files are installed/downloaded in the same folder.  
To run the program, open the terminal in that folder and type: make
